RNNoise is a noise suppression library based on a recurrent neural network.
A description of the algorithm is provided in the following paper:

J.-M. Valin, A Hybrid DSP/Deep Learning Approach to Real-Time Full-Band Speech
Enhancement, Proceedings of IEEE Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP) Workshop,
arXiv:1709.08243, 2018.
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.08243.pdf

An interactive demo is available at: https://jmvalin.ca/demo/rnnoise/

To compile, just type:
% ./autogen.sh
% ./configure
% make

Optionally:
% make install

While it is meant to be used as a library, a simple command-line tool is
provided as an example. It operates on RAW 16-bit (machine endian) mono
PCM files sampled at 48 kHz. It can be used as:

./examples/rnnoise_demo <noisy speech> <output denoised>

The output is also a 16-bit raw PCM file.

The latest version of the source is available from
https://gitlab.xiph.org/xiph/rnnoise .  The github repository
is a convenience copy.
